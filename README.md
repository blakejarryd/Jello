## About Our Project
Jello is our take on a ToDo list, a mix between a Kanban board and a ToDo List. 
We allow the user to take charge of their tasks, whether that be working in a team to develop a website or managing your shopping list, Jello is there to help.

## Blockers
We all had some blockers on the way that stopped us working at full pace.
Even though we worked very well as a team, but some problems such as;
  - The dragging and dropping of the cards is a very difficult problem that took a while to implement, because
  - Login logout functionality was difficult to implement just due to the complexity of the app that was there already

## Future Features
#### Efficiency:
The code is still not as efficient as we all would like it to be. Manily the drag and drop features are a little slow and buggy. Streamlining this code would be the first thing that we would all like to see. 
#### More React DnD:
The rearranging of columns is something that would be awesome to have working in the future. 
This would need even more react dnd than is already existing, and is not something I really want to do.
#### Assigning Users to Cards:
Allowing users to assign themselves to a card, as an indication they are completing the task, this would be a two way relational database which is quite difficult to implement
#### Boards That Belong to Multiple Users:
This is another one that would require a lot of supporting code that we did not have time for. The code allowing users to search through a database of other users is also a security risk that we would need to understand further before implementing the feature.
